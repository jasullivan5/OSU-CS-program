This is the moon you looked up to when you were a kid, and the primary reason you wanted to become a space traveler. Though it might not seem impressive as there are only rocks and caves, there are no threats to your life exploring here. Earth's moon was not home to Earthlings when you left decades ago, but overtime a small colony has been created. Interact with locals and see if there is any gas available for you to return home with. As a side note - they may be humans, but they prefer to be called mumans.
