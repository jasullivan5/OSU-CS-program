As the biggest planet in this galaxy, it's no surprise there's a second part to it! Try to stay away from the dust storm, as you will get blown away.  Though it can't support life, it has been said that there are mushrooms around the core. One of the theories is its connecting side is actually a moon "Lost moon", which had the Interaster species. They used to enjoy coming here on their sabbaticals, eating their mushrooms, and fighting the giant storm for sport. These mushrooms are leftovers from those times. You have 20 seconds to find a mushroom and eat it before you die from suffocation.
