Pluto is a dwarf planet that is fairly cold. Make sure to bring your jacket! It can be slippery due to the ice caverns, but it is plentiful in resources. It contains the Milkast lifeforms that worship a crysallith. In order to set foot peacefully on this planet, one needs to go to Pluto’s moon and obtain the crysallith. Once you obtain the crysallith, be sure to give it to their leader. A specific ice cavern holds the Doohickey which can be added to the hyperdrive, giving it power.
