Saturn, the second largest planet in the Milky Way! It is impossible to land on the actual planet as it is a large ball of gas, but it is possible to land on its rings. Walk along the icy rings and see if you can find the wealth of the God it is named after. There is no need to worry about other life on these rings as they are shattered pieces of the galaxy. If you wait long enough you may see an aurora.
Amount of years taken to arrive: 6
