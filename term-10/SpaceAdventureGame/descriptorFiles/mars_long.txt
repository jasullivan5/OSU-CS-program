Have fun exploring! This planet not only made of mountains. It contains volcanoes, canyon,and ice caps. This is the most visited planet of all of the planets in the Milky Way Galaxy by Earthlings-- or at least when you left Earth in 2019. The Opportunity Rover is still somewhere around here. Interact with it and it will reward you, as they miss their creators.
