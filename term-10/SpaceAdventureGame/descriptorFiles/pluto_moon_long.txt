Home of the majestic Crysallith. The Milkath refer to this rock as their moon, but you seem to think it's an asteroid. In the end it doesn't matter. The Milkath have worshipped the Crysallith since the formation of their planet in 00 BC. Some of the older Milkath have even said they know someone who knows someone who looked directly at it and went blind. Either way, get a chunk and bring it to the Milkath's leader and they will help you find the Doohickey.
