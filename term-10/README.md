In my final term, I took a Capstone course in which I was placed on a team with two other students to work on a term long programming project of our choosing. We developed a space themed text adventure game with C++. Players begin the game at one of two random starting locations in the solar system. They also have a spaceship, a random amount of fuel, and a limited number of years left to complete the game. The player's goal is to explore the solar system and collect items for repairing their ship so they can return to Earth before they run out of fuel or die of old age. Players are able to save their progress and load it again later. The game also includes ASCII art for each location. My main role on the team was to develop the command parser. The parser searches a series of verb and noun files, comparing words from the user's input to words in these files. If it finds a match, it will return a command or noun that the game engine can recognize. This allows the user to enter a variety of commands and sentence structures that the game will recognize.
