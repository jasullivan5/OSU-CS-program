During my 3rd term, I took Computer Architecture and Assembly Language in which I learned how to code in MASM x86 assembly language.
The program array-sum-and-average gets 10 integers fro the user, stores them in an array, computes their sum and average, then
displays the array, sum and average on the console. This program can be run with Visaul Studio and requires the Irvine32 library.
