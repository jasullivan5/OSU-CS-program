During term 4, I took Introduction to Web Development in which
I learned HTML, CSS, javascript, node.js, express.js with handlebars templating, and some basic server side
and database development. The files for my first website are posted here. It is a website that has information about me, my resume, and a link to my github. Some of the information across the various pages is redundant. This was necessary for satisfying assignment requirements.
The website is not currently hosted.
