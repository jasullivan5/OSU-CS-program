During term 4, I took Introduction to Web Development in which
I learned HTML, CSS, javascript, node.js, express.js with handlebars templating, and some basic server side
and database development. The files for my first website are posted here. It is a website that has information about me, my resume, and a link to my github. Some of the information across the various pages is redundant. This was necessary for satisfying assignment requirements.
A current version of this website is hosted at http://personal-website-joe-sullivan.a3c1.starter-us-west-1.openshiftapps.com/
