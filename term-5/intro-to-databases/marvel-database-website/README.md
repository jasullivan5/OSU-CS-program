These are the files for my marvel superhero database and website. At the website, the client can view, fitler, and edit tables that contain data related to marvel characters and films. This site is not currently hosted. Also included is a pdf of my database design, entity relationship diagram, and MySQL database definition queries. The server side code uses node.js and express.js with handlebars templating.
