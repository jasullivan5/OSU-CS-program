In term 5, I took Operating Systems 1 in which I learned about shells, scripts, multi-threading, multi-processing, and multi-programming. Additionally, I learned about process management, inter-process communication, and communication across networks.
I also took Introduction to Databases where I learned to design and develop databases using MySQL. I also developed a website that allows the client to access a database via the server.
