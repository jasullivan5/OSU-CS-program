This is my recipes API. It was developed using node.js and express.js. It is not currently hosted, but during my course it was hosted using Google Cloud's App Engine. Google's Cloud Datastore was used to store and manage data. Auth0 was used to authorize users. Once a user was authorized they could add to, remove from, or modify lists of recipes and ingredients. Ingredients could also be added to or removed from a recipes ingredient list.
