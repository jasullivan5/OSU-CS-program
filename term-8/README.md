In my 8th term, I took Introduction to Networks. I learned about the five layers of the internet protocol stack, configuration and implementation of local area networks and intranets, internet protocols, packet forwarding, and routing. I created two C programs. One allows a server and client to chat via a TCP connection. The other allows a client to request files from a server's current working directory and create a copy of the file in the clients current working directory.
