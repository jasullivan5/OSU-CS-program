In my second assignment, I developed random tests for three cards of the dominion.c program. These tests are the files randomtestcard1.c, randomtestcard2.c, and randomtestadventurer.c These tests can be compiled and run by typing "make randomtestresults". This also produces a test result file for each test called randomtestcar1.out, reandomtestcard2.out, and randomtestadventurer.out.
